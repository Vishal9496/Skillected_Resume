# My HTML & CSS Resume

Hey there 👋
This is a simple HTML & CSS project I made to create my LinkedIn-style resume. It’s clean, easy to edit, and can be viewed directly in any browser  no frameworks or extra setup needed.

💡 About the Project

I wanted to make a resume webpage that shows my details, skills, and projects in a clear format  something I could share on GitHub or even host online.

It includes:

My profile photo and contact details

A short professional summary

My main projects, internships, and skills

Education background

It’s basically a digital version of my resume — simple but neat!

🧰 Tech Used

HTML5 – for structure

CSS3 – for basic styling

That’s it! No JavaScript, no frameworks. Just clean and direct.
